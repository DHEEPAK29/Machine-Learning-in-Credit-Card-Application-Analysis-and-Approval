# Machine-Learning-in-Credit-Card-Application-Analysis-and-Approval

This project focused on designing a machine learning framework for analyzing and approving credit card applications. The framework included automated data processing and modeling to predict the likelihood of application approval based on various criteria. By enabling users to add datasets in a prescribed format, the system provided seamless prediction results, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the credit card approval process.

Libraries Used: xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, Keras, Scikit-Learn (linear model, tree, ensemble, svm), Seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, and pandas.
